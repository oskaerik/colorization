# Automatic Image Colorization

## Colorful Image Colorization
This project aims to reproduce the results from [Colorful Image Colorization](https://richzhang.github.io/colorization/) with some modifications. The files `resources/bins.npy` and `LICENSE` are copied from their repo.

## Data
Instead of training on the entire [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/) dataset, we train on the [Stanford Dogs](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/) dataset. It is expected that this dataset is extracted in the `data/` directory.
