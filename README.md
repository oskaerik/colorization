# Automatic Image Colorization
This is our project for [KTH-DD2424: Deep Learning in Data Science](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/DD2424?l=en). We aim to reproduce the results from [Colorful Image Colorization](https://richzhang.github.io/colorization/) with some modifications. The files `resources/bins.npy` and `LICENSE` are copied from their repo. The colorization module resides under `colorize/`, and the notebooks demonstrate its usage. However, we have not cleaned up the repo in any way.

The final report is available as `project-report.pdf`. Some examples where our models perform well:
